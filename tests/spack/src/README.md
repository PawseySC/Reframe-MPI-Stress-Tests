This directory contains three files - `modules.yaml`, `spack.yaml`, and `spack.lock`. These are minimal examples of the spack files needed for the Spack tests to work. The `spack.lock` file should be generated by spack during concretisation. The `modules.yaml` and `spack.yaml` should be written by you specific and be specific to the setup of your software stack and module tree.

`modules.yaml` defines the module system used (e.g. `tcl` vs `lmod`) and controls module generation. The role of this file in these tests is to match a package spec with a full module path using the defined projections in this file.

`spack.yaml` defines the abstract specs for the packages spack is to install. This file is used in the `concretise_check` test to compare the abstract specs pre-concretisation with the concretised specs post-concretisation.

`spack.lock` defines the concrete specs related to the abstract specs defined in the `spack.yaml` file. There are the root specs for the primary packages as well as the concretised specs for all the package dependencies.
